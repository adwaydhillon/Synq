# Synq - MHacks V (2015)
Synq is an Android Application that aims to make sharing contacts and updating information easy. 

Normally, if your phone number changes, you would have to tell all of your friends individually that your number changed and give them your new phone number. However with Synq, you just update your profile in Synq, and it updates all of your friend's phonebooks. Other applications include partial contact sharing, such as sharing only your work phone with colleagues and personal phone with friends. Synq also makes it possible for you to undo giving someone your phone number, or blocking someone effectively. You no longer have to worry about backing contacts up, or making sure everyone's information is up to date.
